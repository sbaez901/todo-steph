What did I do to create the project:


Install the vue cli globally:

    $ npm update -g @vue/cli

also install `yarn`, used by the `vue` command:

    $ npm update -g yarn

Then use the newly installed `vue` command to create
the skeleton of the app.

    $ vue create todo-step

(in the choices given, I picked 'Default (Vue 3)')

Then you launch the application in development mode:

    $ npm run serve

aaaand it should be available on http://localhost:8080, and should
update as you play with the source code. Enjoy!
